# WebSecurity

This is my project for the Software Security exam.

The goal is to make a web application secure.

I created a vulnerable application using Spring Boot for the backend and MySQL as the database. For the frontend, I used HTML and JavaScript.

I researched the vulnerabilities of the application that does not adopt security countermeasures, focusing in particular on SQL Injection and XSS attacks, especially how cookie theft can occur.

I defined a series of countermeasures for the vulnerabilities found.

The entire project was complemented by static analysis using the tools SpotBugs and SonarCloud, and dynamic analysis using OWASP ZAP.
